## Quality requirements (every draft must satisfy all of these)

**Etymology scholar box** (required, ≥ 3 paragraphs):
- Open with: component analysis — which radicals/phonetic components make up the character, what each means
- Include: oracle-bone or bronze inscription description if known; how the visual form changed
- Include: semantic range — how the meaning extended from the concrete to the abstract
- Optional: cross-civilizational note (Japanese, Vietnamese, or Korean usage of the same character)

**Compound sections** (≥ 3 vocabulary sections total beyond etymology):
- Each section has a thematic title in Chinese + pinyin + English
- Open each section with either a `.pattern` (showing the morphological rule) or a `.scholar` insight box
- Each `.cards` group: 3-5 cards, rotating through `.c-red`, `.c-ochre`, `.c-teal`, `.c-violet`, `.c-sienna`
- Each card: `.card-head` (cn, pinyin, English gloss) + `.tags` (POS: tag-v / tag-n / tag-adj / tag-vn) + `.card-def` (definition with component breakdown) + `.examples` (2-3 examples with cn/pinyin/en) + optionally `.note` (contrastive, cultural, or pragmatic note)
- Examples must be natural, idiomatic Mandarin — not textbook-stilted

**Chengyu** (required, ≥ 3):
- Include the classical source (Analects, Mencius, Shiji, etc.) when traceable
- Note modern usage register and typical contexts
- Include a full `.cy-note` — not just a translation

**Retention image** (required):
- Open with a concrete sensory image — place, moment, physical experience
- Connect the image to the character's visual form or component decomposition
- Extend the image into the compound pattern — show how the root meaning flows through all the key words

**Voice and register:**
- Scholarly but accessible — write for a curious English reader who is learning Mandarin, not for a linguistics professor
- Never write "This character means X" as an opener — open with the etymology or image
- Prefer active, specific prose: "The oracle bone shows a hand grasping a sprout" not "It depicts a hand and a plant"
- Avoid hedging phrases: "seems to," "it is thought that," "possibly" — commit to the most defensible reading

## Exemplar: 道 dào (condensed)

Below is a condensed excerpt from the 道 page to show the expected density, voice, and structure.

### Etymology box (from 道 dào):
> **道 dào = 辶 chuò** (the walk-movement radical — a foot in motion) **+ 首 shǒu** (head). A head moving purposefully forward along a path: the guided way, navigated with intelligence. Oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions show a crossroads with a head positioned at it — the moment of choosing direction, of reading the way ahead. 道 encodes both the physical path AND the principle of navigation simultaneously.
>
> This ambiguity was not an accident — it was an invitation. Laozi seized it: 道可道，非常道 — "The Way that can be spoken is not the eternal Way."
>
> In Japanese, 道 *dō* becomes the suffix for every traditional discipline-art that embodies a "Way" of practice: 柔道 *jūdō*, 茶道 *sadō*, 書道 *shodō*. One character carrying two civilizations' deepest conceptions of pursuing excellence.

### Card example (from 道, 知道 zhīdào):
> 知 zhī (to know; knowledge) + 道 dào (way; path). The most common verb of knowledge in everyday speech. 知道 covers factual awareness, learned information, and received news — knowing that something is the case.
>
> Note — *Three Kinds of Knowing:* 知道 = factual / informational knowledge (know that). 了解 liǎojiě = deeper, contextual understanding. 认识 rènshi = to know a person; to recognize.

### Chengyu example (from 道, 任重道远):
> **任重道远** — "the burden is heavy, the road is far" — great responsibility with a long journey ahead. From the Analects of Confucius: 仁以为己任，不亦重乎？死而后已，不亦远乎？Used to describe serious long-term undertakings: social reform, academic work, national development. Conveys gravitas without complaint.

### Retention image (from 道):
> A crossroads at dawn. Four paths, no signs. The ancient character shows a head positioned at that crossroads, moving forward. 道 is not one path but the knowing of how to walk any path — the intelligence that reads the terrain and chooses direction.
>
> When Laozi wrote 道可道，非常道, he was standing at that crossroads, pointing at all four paths simultaneously, refusing to collapse the mystery into a single direction. The eternal 道 remains the capacity to read any terrain, not the map of one particular road.
